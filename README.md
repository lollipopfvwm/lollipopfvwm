	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>This is my personal Fvwm3 window manager configuration.</p>
	<p>Created and modified over many years, aiming to improve and simplify settings.</p>
	<p>
	This configuration is basically done in shell script, making use of variables to modify almost all Fvwm features. Just read the comments of each variable to know what will happen, all very simple and easy to understand.
	</p>
	<p>Below are some of the things that are being done for this configuration.</p>

<p>
Here we have the kitty terminal, using the light and dark LolliPop themes.
This theme is also applied in other applications, such as the neovim text editor, the alacritty terminal, tmux, gtk theme, icon theme and in Fvwm of course.

	In this image we have the <strong>kitty</strong> and <strong>alacritty</strong> terminals using the LolliPop Dark theme
	They also have a clear theme, and some others are being developed, with care and time, so that they are always fluid and pleasing to the eye.
