	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>This is my personal Fvwm3 window manager configuration.</p>
	<p>Created and modified over many years, aiming to improve and simplify settings.</p>
	<p>
	This configuration is basically done in shell script, making use of variables to modify almost all Fvwm features. Just read the comments of each variable to know what will happen, all very simple and easy to understand.
	</p>
	<p>Below are some of the things that are being done for this configuration.</p>

<h1>Configuration highlights</h1>
<p align="left"><strong>Color scheme.</strong></p>
<p>
This configuration contains its own color scheme, called LolliPop.
This color scheme is applied in several applications, such as kitty and alacritty terminals, tmux, gtk theme, neovim text editor and Fvwm itself.

	In this image we have the kitty and alacritty terminals using the LolliPop Dark theme
	They also have a clear theme, and some others are being developed, with care and time, so that they are always fluid and pleasing to the eye.
