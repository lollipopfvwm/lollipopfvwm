	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>This is my personal Fvwm3 window manager configuration.</p>
	<p>Created and modified over many years, aiming to improve and simplify settings.</p>
	<p>
	This configuration is basically done in shell script, making use of variables to modify almost all Fvwm features. Just read the comments of each variable to know what will happen, all very simple and easy to understand.
	</p>
	<p>Below are some of the things that are being done for this configuration.</p>

<p>
Here we have the kitty terminal, using the light and dark LolliPop themes.
This theme is also applied in other applications, such as the neovim text editor, the alacritty terminal, tmux, gtk theme, icon theme and in Fvwm of course.

	All the colors were passed to be fluent and pleasing to the eye, to be soft regardless of being light or dark, in the end a good color scheme is part of a good rice.
